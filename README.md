This program we created takes the users name first. Then it takes the age and gives a different response based on the input. If the age is 25 or older, it prints ("Hello " + name + "! Have an amazing day"). If the age is less than 25, it prints, ("Hello " + name + "! Have a wonderful day"). We established this by using if statements. At the end of the program, the user gets either of the two responses with their names.
